The second widget displays the structure of the transition mapping. We see that only two hidden states depend on the action taken by the agent, i.e., the hidden states corresponding to the X and Y position of the shape. The third widget shows the structure of the prior preferences. Here, there is only one factor over three random variables, i.e., the shape and its (X, Y) position. Note, when moving your mouse over a variable in the likelihood, transition or prior preference widget the complete name of the variable is displayed, e.g., when moving over ``S1" the label ``S\_shape" is displayed. The fourth widget illustrates the posterior over the latent variable corresponding to the x position of the shape. The random variable whose posterior is displayed can be changed either by using the combo box in the bottom-right corner of the widget or by clicking on a latent variable in the likelihood model widget. The fifth widget displays information related to the Monte-Carlo tree search. Finally, the last widget illustrates the message sent from the observation variable corresponding to the X position of the shape to its likelihood factor.\relax }}{23}{figure.caption.18}\protected@file@percent }

The first displays the structure of the likelihood model using the factor graph formalism. On this graph, we see that the model is composed of five obervations and five hidden states. Each observation depends on only one hidden state. The second widget displays the structure of the transition mapping.
